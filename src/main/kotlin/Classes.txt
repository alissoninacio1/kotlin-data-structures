In Kotlin, data classes are specialized for storing data
with automatically generated methods like equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and copy(),
making them similar to JavaScript's objects literals (const obj = {})
which are flexible key-value pairs but lack these automatic methods.

For more complex structures involving inheritance and polymorphism, Kotlin uses regular classes with clear syntax
for overriding methods (open and override keywords),
while JavaScript also supports these concepts with its ES6 class syntax (class, extends, constructor)
